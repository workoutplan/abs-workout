From our review, here’s the info you need on lit: It does have a pretty decent ingredient profile though, although it’s still not the cheapest for what it offers.

<p>Usually, this can be accounted for by the caffeine content. The flavors are so cool like snow cone and cotton candy, which replaces the ubiquitous fruit punch flavor found in all pre workout supplements.

<p>In our opinion, it’s just not a very well rounded supplement. Lit af’s formula weighs 19.70, but with filler ingredients it goes up to 24.26g. To compare, 1 scoop of c4 is 150mg.
