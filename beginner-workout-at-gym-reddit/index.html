Take one day off from weight training between each workout. Perform this workout at least two times per week, significant strength and fitness gains are obtained with only two workouts per week. Start off slow and gradually adjust the incline, resistance, or speed if you think you can handle more. Keep your legs stationary, and twist your torso, left and right.
