This program is designed for those who have been doing some running or walking for a few weeks. To get the most out of it, you should already be able to run at least 5km, and ideally 10km, comfortably. The more advanced plans use a marathon pace run one day, followed by a long run the next day, as well as some speedwork. The training plan is for you if it’s the first time you’ve run a marathon, or a long time since you ran any longer distances.
