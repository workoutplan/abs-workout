Weight Loss Exercises At Home Without Equipment From latestfashiontips.com
This is an air squat, meaning no equipment necessary! I’d love to hear how this workout went for you, and how else we can help! You’ll begin by performing three straight leg exercises to torch your quads, hamstrings, and glutes, and then end with two supersets of upper body bodyweight exercises, leaving you gasping for air. The main difference between resistance training at home for building muscle vs losing fat is that with losing fat, you are doing full body workouts and your rest time should be limited, which also means you will be using lighter weight loads, as that’s the only way you’ll be able to limit your rest time.
