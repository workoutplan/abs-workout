What To Eat Before &amp; After A Workout üòÑüëçüí™üíØ Workout From br.pinterest.com
Carbs during or after training are good for performance if you train twice a day or longer than 90 minutes, but are mostly neutral for muscle building, and are bad for fat loss. You can get protein from meats like chicken or fish, but you can also get it from plants like soybeans, garbanzo beans, or nuts. ‚Äúconsuming protein every five to six hours is optimal for muscle building, and training anywhere in that window is fine,‚Äù says schoenfeld. I still recommend my clients have some protein before and after training to err on the side of caution.
