Leg Workout with No Weights A 7Minute AtHome Routine From beefiddle.com
Side lunges are another great toning workout for your legs. This workout should take no longer than 45 minutes in total, and targets the glutes, quadriceps, and conditioning. Stand in the loop of the band you just used for the leg curl, hooking it around the back of your knees, and face the attachment point. Slowly extend your knees again.
