TRY KENDALL JENNERS AB WORKOUT WITH ME (INSANE RESULTS) SAM&#39;s HEALTH From samuelallenscott.net
Kendall says that she loves working out her abs, and this is often a focus of her workouts with her trainer. She also incorporates exercising disciplines like hot yoga, kickboxing, swimming, etc. While i’m sure there’s a lot of cardio, strict eating, and professional trainers also at work, i figured there couldn’t be any harm in trying to work the quick ab routine into my daily schedule. We all know models are genetically blessed—but you&#39;d be a fool to think they don&#39;t sweat hard in the gym to tone and perfect their muscles.
