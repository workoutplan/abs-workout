Workout Music 2017 Top 100 Hits Pilates Yoga Dance Fitness Remixes 6 Hr From open.spotify.com
These mixes were spun by my personal favorite dj on the station at the time, dj enrie. Born in new york city but a transplanted californian, dj enrie began working at the american record pool after hitting the west coast but later moved to l.a.&#39;s power 106, soon establishing himself as one of the city&#39;s top mixers with a style encompassing latin, house and freestyle. Enrie started this website for djs to upload their mixes, and have all their fans to come download it. Nice memories of the good ol&#39; times provided by power 106 in los angeles when house music was at its peak and dancing til dawn with good music was a priority.
