What Happens After You Stop Taking Creatine From workoutwalls.blogspot.com
You can take creatine on rest days, but the timing is less important than on days you work out. Based on user reviews, taking creatine before working out helps to improve muscle stores and energy. Try to take this with a meal or a protein shake, as the protein and the amino acids help your body to retain creatine. While there’s no solid evidence one way of the other when it comes to timing your creatine intake, it’s probably best to hedge your bets and take some before and after your workout.
