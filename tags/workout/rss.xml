Alani Nu BCAA Amino Acids Recovery All Flavors 30 From ebay.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to try the other two flavors but as of right now i think i can safely say that the best flavor of alani nu pre workout is the cotton candy grape. One concern for our research team is the fact. The alani nu team must be pretty fond of rainbow candy because this is the second product that they’ve made that has the rainbow candy theme. The chocolate flavor of alani nu whey protein was a great way for my taste buds to get acclimated to the style of flavor that alani nu proteins use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
