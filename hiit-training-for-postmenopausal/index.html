For many women, hiit workouts can be significantly more effective than endurance workouts for overall weight and fat loss during menopause. Remember a lot will depend on your goals and your body’s capabilities, but hiit can benefit every body! It incorporates several rounds that alternate between several minutes of high intensity movements to significantly increase the heart rate to at least 80% of one’s maximum heart rate, followed by short periods of lower intensity movements. Cycling hiit seems more effective than running, especially in postmenopausal women, and training interventions longer than 8 weeks comprising three sessions a week should be promoted.
