M/29/6&#39;8&#34; [329lbs &gt; 277lbs = 51 lbs] Weight loss progress From reddit.com
I have my solid meal 1 hour before my workout consisting out of sweet potatos for carbs. Many different vitamins can also help with performance and recovery. Simple carbohydrates are great for 30 minutes to an hour before a workout as they provide the body with fast acting glucose as fuel. Some people prefer doing a “fasted cardio.”.
