What Expiration Dates Really Mean Greatist From greatist.com
So i have a couple pre workout products that are going to expire in about 2 weeks and i know i will not be able to finish them all before they expire so i was wondering if i should just throw them out or if they are safe to use for a few months after there expiration date?

It’s going to lose its potency.
