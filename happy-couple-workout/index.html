Happy Couple Exercise Dumbbell In Gym Stock Image Image of club, body From dreamstime.com
This extremely personal exercise can leave you and your partner with much better insight into each other, into yourselves, and into your relationship (suval, 2015). These exercises will put you on a path to a deeper understanding of yourself, your partner, and your relationship. Other fitness routines are fueled by this malcontent or negative energy around what is wrong and needs to be fixed. When your set is complete, your partner begins her set, and vice versa, until all sets are finished.
