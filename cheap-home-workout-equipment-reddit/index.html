The Best, Affordable HomeGym Equipment That Actually From verityweekly.com
I have a squat rack, barbell, barbell weights (45, 35, 25, 10x2, 5, 2.5, 1,.75,.5,.25), bench, and a rock climbing hangboard. Add resistance to aerobics, circuits, or just about any home workout with these adjustable wrist and ankle weights. Hopefully this helps someone looking for a workout. Jump ropes generally cost less than $20 and they deliver a killer cardio workout you can do practically anywhere.
