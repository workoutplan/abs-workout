Building on the beloved mechanics of vr rhythm games, supernatural is the first app that offers the full fitness package for vr. It seems like a good process and the workout i tried was enjoyable, music was not my cup of tea, but it was good to see so many noteworthy songs.</p>
<h3 id="supernatural-is-a-vr-fitness-app-for-oculus-quest-that-promises-to-gamify-your-weekly-exercise-routine-with-an-expansive-library-of-cardio-boxing-meditation-and-recovery-workouts">Supernatural Is A Vr Fitness App For Oculus Quest That Promises To Gamify Your Weekly Exercise Routine With An Expansive Library Of Cardio, Boxing, Meditation And Recovery Workouts.</h3><p>That shouldn’t be a surprise because it’s clearly inspired by vr rhythm games that came before it — as its creators freely admit —. What makes supernatural different is that you get to do your workouts in one of several gorgeous locations around the globe. There are many fitness games available for the oculus quest 2, so supernatural’s subscription model makes it rather different. I wouldn’t say my muscles were ever sore.</p>
