<p>Love the sufferfest workouts and science behind them. The story lines during the videos are great and i love the humor. Garmin quietly rolled out an update yesterday that means you’ll now get training load updated on your garmin devices for workouts done in zwift, trainerroad, the sufferfest, and the tacx app, all without using a garmin device to record them. This workout is just shy of three hours long and combines all the nasty bits from 11 different workouts.</p>
