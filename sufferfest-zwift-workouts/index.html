<p>Love the sufferfest workouts and science behind them. The story lines during the videos are great and i love the humor. Garmin quietly rolled out an update yesterday that means youâll now get training load updated on your garmin devices for workouts done in zwift, trainerroad, the sufferfest, and the tacx app, all without using a garmin device to record them. This workout is just shy of three hours long and combines all the nasty bits from 11 different workouts.</p>
