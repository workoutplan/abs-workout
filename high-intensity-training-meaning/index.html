<p>Nautilus inventor arthur jones helped define and popularize hit in the 1970’s, often summarizing the general philosophy as “…train harder, but train briefer” or “…train harder, but train less often”.

<p>You might simply look at this definition of intensity in terms of ‘difficultly’. Perceived exertion may not always be similar to your heart rate level, and it depends on the individual. Intensity of effort groups that are usually associated with the hit (high intensity of training) theory tend to define intensity in their own way which has to do with relative closeness to failure or simply the effort expended during the set.
