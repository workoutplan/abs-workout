<p>I'm not sure if preworkout as a whole can expire. We know all the best by, use by, sell by terminology you see on products can get confusing, so here's a quick explanation of what that means. So i have a couple pre workout products that are going to expire in about 2 weeks and i know i will not be able to finish them all before they expire so i was wondering if i should just throw them out or if they are safe to use for a few months after there expiration date? All food grade products eventually expire and can become potentially unsafe to consume.</p>
