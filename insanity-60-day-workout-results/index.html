<p>Once you have completed the 60 days of insanity and you have the results you desire, can you (or do most people) go back through the dvds and continue to do these workouts to sustain or even build more muscle and fitness? I decided to take up doing this workout challenge as i was starting to get quite a few negative comments from work colleagues eg jamie you're getting fat etc. Insanity is a great workout and will get results much faster than most workouts, but you still have to be patient.
