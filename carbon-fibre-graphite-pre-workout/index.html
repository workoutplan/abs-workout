<p>Carbon fibre (also called graphite fibre) is the most prestigious material that’s used not only in racing but also in aerospace, military and other competition sports where lightness is the most important factor. Advanced composite materials, such as prepregs, have been utilized by the formula 1 and motorsport markets for almost 40 years. Its unique combination of high strength and low weight has helped drive the wind power revolution and. The fibers are next coated with resin.</p>
